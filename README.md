# Inspiration
We’ve all experienced the struggle to describe how you feel before, whether it’s pain, discomfort, or just a general sense of unease. When you’re not feeling well, trying to put your symptoms into words can be frustrating, especially when those words don’t fully capture the complexity of what you’re experiencing.

# What it does
Our Symptom Interpreter translates your words into accurate medical terms, helping you better express your symptoms and prepare for your doctor’s visit. Simply enter your symptoms, discomforts, or pain, and we’ll provide clear, medically-accurate terminology with definitions to support you in communicating your health concerns.
